On finding themselves stranded in the desert, the party immediately started arguing with themselves. An injured survivor of the crash begged for their help, but he was promptly beaten to death and chopped up for meat. They found a few items in the broken remains of the sail-barge and set out towards a cave Krete spotted earlier. Reniél decided that now was the time to apply her academic knowledge of desert fauna and transform herself into a camel, with impressive results. Hot, thirsty and miserable, they set out into the desert wastes.

Meanwhile, Lucky spent a lovely night in the comfort of the Bronze Vessel, and while eating a hearty breakfast, she noticed a blinking magical sigil on a wall panel. Following it to the engine deck, she finds a man strapped to a chair, covered in a thin mucus, hooked up to the engine with a massive pile of serpentine cables. A strange contraption bolts his mouth shut. Upon releasing him, he feebly tries and fails to escape and then introduces himself as Mark Potter. He had been kidnapped and forced into this contraption by the previous crew. Mark helps Lucky locate her missing helmsman and finds that he's been hung by a hook outside the walls of Londinum, along with Gimbletink.

The crew finally arrives at the cave, where they can rest for the night. They are thirsty, miserable, and overheated, but they are glad to get some rest. In the morning, Moses, Lucky and Krete explore the cave of oily black stone. Following a path cleaved into the deep rock, they find a series of mysterious murals and a large ziggurat squatting in a gaping cavern. Leaving whatever that was, they prepare for the misery of the desert by milking Reniél and slaughtering Elania.

With a night to cool off, Lucky attempts to reintroduce herself to Mark Potter and invites him to a drinking game. During the carousing, Mark reveals that the last person he remembers talking to is Rictavio, your vampire-hunting friend.

Gasping in the miserable heat of the desert, the crew encounters a friendly native named Yemi. He assumes you're also going on a pilgrimage to see the Messiah and says he's heading towards the Holy City. He sits astride a Kafervagon, a gigantic tick-like creature covered in awesome painted red flames. A thick, rough rope straps various boxes, jars, and platforms along its shell. They bargain a ride to the Holy City of Acheron with their fresh camel milk.
#### Plunder
- A rusty metal pipe
- A torn canvas sail 
- Fresh camel milk
- 100 pounds of human meat

### Spice World
While making dinner, Blackbeard noticed that the barrel of pickled pork had a false bottom and contained several dozen bricks of a mysterious golden substance. The first mate, Elaina Sartell panics and realises that her contact used her to smuggle spice to Ert unwittingly. After a brief argument where Elaina threw a packet of the spice everywhere, Elania convinced everyone to go to Spice World, also known as Sailor's Doom, to deliver the goods back to the Spice Cartel.

Upon landing on Spice World, the crew met with the head of House Saxe-Gotha, Thane Edmund. Thanking everyone for the return of his property, he offered the reward of not immediately killing everyone. Thane Edmund stripped the crew of all their worldly possessions and sent them into the Deep Desert on a sail-barge, which promptly crashed and stranded everyone.

Meanwhile, Captain Lucky watched the proceedings from the shadows and promptly tried to sneak back aboard the Bronze Vessel. She nimbly avoided the best efforts of the Saxe-Gotha Royal Guards and found her ship landlocked by enchanted chains. She stowed away back on her boat for a nap.

### Astral Rain
The party activated a mysterious bronze contraption in the Wizard of Wines barn, using a purple gemstone the retrieved from Yester Hill. Kretē somehow got the mysterious device to fly out into space.

The party is adrift without any hope of escape. After Kretē managed to get the strange contraption to take off, it sputtered out with a series of sparks and acrid smoke. The bronze mechanics have gone still.

Meanwhile, Blackbeard is facing a curious phenomenon of strange pods falling from the sky in the city of Turtleport. One erupted and spewed forth strange crystalline vines that attacked anything nearby. She followed a redheaded captain to a ship, snuck aboard past some brigands, and helped Captain Elaina Sartell escape in to the wild ether. The strange crystalline creatures consume the quaint city of Turtleport. From the safety of the Moondancer, Blackbeard sees her entire planet erupt in glittering crystal spires.

### Attack of the Star Moth
Elaina Sartell has no idea what was happening, but supposed that someone at Rock of Bral might. Blackbeard met the only other crewmate, the ship's navigator Flapjack, and was assigned the role of cook. Before they got too far out from Ert, a glittering ship resembling a gigantic moth ambushes them. These are "Space Elves" according to Captain Sartell, and while the Moondancer was a fast ship, it can't outrun Space Elves. Captain Sartell sees a smaller junked vessel floating nearby, and hopes that it has a faster engine than the Moondancer.

Meanwhile, the party resting in the Bronze Vessel have been adrift for two weeks. They're out of food, out of water, and slowly going mad from Space Sickness. From the black tides of space two ships came rolling forth, locked in combat. The crew of the first ship abandoned the vessel, swung aboard with a barrel of pickled pork, a redheaded human, and a strange jellyfish creature. Blackbeard misjudged the jump and was saved by Reniél.

Once aboard Elaina Sartell immediately challenged Acting Captain Luc(k)y. The question was put to a vote, with a 3-4 vote going to Luc(k)y. She then appointed Elaina Sartell as First Mate and Flapjack as Navigator. Her first official act was getting the hell out of there, and launched the Bronze Vessel away from the attacking Space Elves.

#### Plunder
- A barrel of pickled pork, enough to nourish ten Medium creatures for two days.

### Treacherous Salvage
After a hearty meal, the party happened upon a derelict Nautiloid. Warned of the dangers of Mind Flayers by First Mate Elaina Sartell, they decided to risk it to salvage whatever supplies might be handy.

The ship is tomb, all of the Mind Flayers beheaded, and blood is everywhere. They found Benito, a survivor of the attacks, who begs for help to get off this cursed boat. After some argument Kretē shoots him in the leg. He revealed that he wasn't human but a species called a Psurlon, and had planned to ambush the party with his mates. Apologising, he claims he just wants a way off. As he begged for mercy, Kretē shoots him in the head.

But the crew did find a cache of supplies, a fine magical breastplate, a horrible monster in the basement, and another worse monster in the cupboard. As they were picking the place clean, an alarm went off in the Bronze Vessel, and a dark shape glides out. It resembles a giant spider, complete with long delicate legs and weblike rigging. Starlight gleams off its metallic hull as it creeps silently towards your vessel.

"A Nightspider!" shouts First Mate Sartell. "The neogi were using this hulk as bait, and we've flown right into their web!"

#### Plunder
- A magical breastplate
- Food and water to nourish ten Medium creatures for five days
- Several barrels of pickled brains
