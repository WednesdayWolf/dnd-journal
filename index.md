### Astral Rain
The party activated a mysterious bronze contraption in the Wizard of Wines barn, using a purple gemstone the retrieved from Yester Hill. Kretē somehow got the mysterious device to fly out into space.

The party is adrift without any hope of escape. After Kretē managed to get the strange contraption to take off, it sputtered out with a series of sparks and acrid smoke. The bronze mechanics have gone still.

Meanwhile, Blackbeard is facing a curious phenomenon of strange pods falling from the sky in the city of Turtleport. One erupted and spewed forth strange crystalline vines that attacked anything nearby. She followed a redheaded captain to a ship, snuck aboard past some brigands, and helped Captain Elaina Sartell escape in to the wild ether. The strange crystalline creatures consume the quaint city of Turtleport. From the safety of the Moondancer, Blackbeard sees her entire planet erupt in glittering crystal spires.

### Attack of the Star Moth
Elaina Sartell has no idea what was happening, but supposed that someone at Rock of Bral might. Blackbeard met the only other crewmate, the ship's navigator Flapjack, and was assigned the role of cook. Before they got too far out from Ert, a glittering ship resembling a gigantic moth ambushes them. These are "Space Elves" according to Captain Sartell, and while the Moondancer was a fast ship, it can't outrun Space Elves. Captain Sartell sees a smaller junked vessel floating nearby, and hopes that it has a faster engine than the Moondancer.

Meanwhile, the party resting in the Bronze Vessel have been adrift for two weeks. They're out of food, out of water, and slowly going mad from Space Sickness. From the black tides of space two ships came rolling forth, locked in combat. The crew of the first ship abandoned the vessel, swung aboard with a barrel of pickled pork, a redheaded human, and a strange jellyfish creature. Blackbeard misjudged the jump and was saved by Reniél.

Once aboard Elaina Sartell immediately challenged Acting Captain Luc(k)y. The question was put to a vote, with a 3-4 vote going to Luc(k)y. She then appointed Elaina Sartell as First Mate and Flapjack as Navigator. Her first official act was getting the hell out of there, and launched the Bronze Vessel away from the attacking Space Elves.

#### Plunder
- A barrel of pickled pork, enough to nourish ten Medium creatures for two days.

### Treacherous Salvage
After a hearty meal, the party happened upon a derelict Nautiloid. Warned of the dangers of Mind Flayers by First Mate Elaina Sartell, they decided to risk it to salvage whatever supplies might be handy.

The ship is tomb, all of the Mind Flayers beheaded, and blood is everywhere. They found Benito, a survivor of the attacks, who begs for help to get off this cursed boat. After some argument Kretē shoots him in the leg. He revealed that he wasn't human but a species called a Psurlon, and had planned to ambush the party with his mates. Apologising, he claims he just wants a way off. As he begged for mercy, Kretē shoots him in the head.

But the crew did find a cache of supplies, a fine magical breastplate, a horrible monster in the basement, and another worse monster in the cupboard. As they were picking the place clean, an alarm went off in the Bronze Vessel, and a dark shape glides out. It resembles a giant spider, complete with long delicate legs and weblike rigging. Starlight gleams off its metallic hull as it creeps silently towards your vessel.

"A Nightspider!" shouts First Mate Sartell. "The neogi were using this hulk as bait, and we've flown right into their web!"

#### Plunder
- A magical breastplate
- Food and water to nourish ten Medium creatures for five days
- Several barrels of pickled brains
